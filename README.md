Activity for determining and controlling attitude of satellite using Arduino

This activity makes use of an Arduino Mega as a microcontroller in order to determine attitude and control the angular motion of an actuator. The idea is to provide students with a physical hardware where they can test their attitude determination and control algorithm and realize that what works in simulation may not work when implemented on actual hardware.
